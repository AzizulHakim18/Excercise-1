        <p>Growing up, our family had a tradition of eating lunch every Saturday at our neighborhood’s favorite
            local
            Chinese restaurant. And every single Saturday for lunch, I ordered the same thing — egg drop soup and
            fried
            rice, my absolute favorites. This restaurant set the bar high for me early when it comes to how amazing
            fried rice could be</p>

            <p>You’ve gotta plan ahead and use thoroughly-chilled cooked rice. A fresh batch of warm (or even lukewarm)
                rice
                will not fry well when it hits the hot pan, and will result in soggy and sticky clumps — no good.</p>

            <p>Yes, butter. I have made many a batch of fried rice using various oils, and I’m now convinced there’s a
                reason why Japanese steak houses use that big slab of butter when they’re making fried rice. </p>

            <h2>Recipie Title</h2>
            <p>This is one of my big pet peeves with lame take-out fried rice — not enough veggies! In addition to
                adding
                some nice spots of color, veggies go a long way in adding some flavor and freshness to fried rice. </p>
